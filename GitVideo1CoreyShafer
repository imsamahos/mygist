SVN is central version control system 
Git is a distributed version control system. 
Everybody has a local repository. Good thing is 
when you don't have access to remote repository 
then every developer has a copy on their local systems.

2 common scenarios for people to start with git

1) you have an existing code on your local machine that you wanted to start tracking using git

2) when you have existing project remotely that you want to start tracking

1) Initialize a repository from existing code 
as simple as typing 

--git init

go to the directory you have project files and type git init

you'll find a .git folder created in your folder

if in future you want to stop tracking this folder using git 
all you need to do is remove .git 

rm -rf .git
do an ls -la
--- git status

touch .gitignore 

# to ignore some files having personal preferences, you wouldnt want everyone to see your personal 
preferences so you want to ignore

add files in gitigonore file

git status

gitignore
something.py

Add files to staging area

git add .gitignore

git status 
something.py

adds everything to staging area

git add -A

#remove files from staging area

git reset calc.py

git status

if you want to remove everything from staging area

git reset will remove everything from staging area

if we do git status we will find every file back to the working directory

first commit 

git commit -m "Initial commit" 
 will add the files to repository

Now when we do a git status, it will show working directory is clean 

Another useful command is git log command 
which will list out the commit you just did 


2) Cloning a remote repo 

git clone <url> <where you want to clone>

git clone https://... .(current directory)

viewing information about the remote repository 

git remote -v # list information of remote 
git branch -a


####################################

git add -A
It does the entire working directory 

git add -A specify the directory 
default is -A


git add -u
--update option
only delted and modified files not the new ones

git add .
Similar to A option in the current directory

git add *
