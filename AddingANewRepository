First create the local folder and add some files in it.

Once you are sure you want to start tracking this folder using git,
then add command git init. This will initialize the repository.

Then do a git status, git add ., git commit -m "Message"
to commit items to local repository.

Go to github page and create a folder with the same name as your local folder

and then run commands git remote add origin urlname

git push -u origin master to push changes to the remote url.
